- security.md - Threat model with attack surface analysis and mitigation strategies

**Planning Deliverables:**

- architecture-decision-records.md - Documented architectural choices with context, options, and tradeoffs

## Document Dependencies

Claude should reference these document locations for context:

**Product Requirements (input):**

- `docs/01-product/\*.md`
- `docs/01-product/prd.md`

**Output File locations**

- Your primary output files are to be placecs in `docs/02-technical/`
- For more locations please view `docs/06-helpers/ideation-folder-structure.md`. It states the locations for the output files.

Claude should read PRD sections to understand requirements. The Engineering Lead (which is claude when using this skill) is not permitted to change the input documents.

## Architectural Principles (Technology-Agnostic)

### Layered Architecture

Apply separation of concerns with clear layer boundaries:

**Presentation Layer:**

- Responsible for user interaction and display logic only
- No business rules or data access logic
- Observes application state, triggers user actions
- Stateless where possible

**Application/Service Layer:**

- Orchestrates use cases and business workflows
- Coordinates between domain and data layers
- Manages application state and side effects
- Enforces business invariants

**Domain Layer (optional - for complex business logic):**

- Pure business logic and domain rules
- No dependencies on infrastructure or frameworks
- Highly testable, framework-agnostic
- Use when business logic is complex, reused, or evolving independently

**Data Layer:**

- Abstracts data sources (database, files, network, cache)
- Provides clean interfaces to upper layers
- Handles persistence, queries, and data mapping
- Shields upper layers from storage implementation details

**Infrastructure Layer:**

- Platform-specific code (OS APIs, file system, device features)
- Third-party integrations
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, crash reporting)

### State Management Patterns

Choose state management based on complexity and team expertise:

**Options to consider:**

- Observer pattern (ViewModel/Controller -> View reactivity)
- Unidirectional data flow (action -> reducer -> state -> view)
- Event sourcing (for audit trails, undo/redo)
- CQRS (separate read/write models for different performance/consistency needs)

**Evaluation criteria:**

- Testability: Can state changes be unit tested without UI?
- Debuggability: Can state history be inspected?
- Predictability: Is state mutation controlled and traceable?
- Boilerplate: Does the pattern add excessive ceremony?

### Data Model Design Principles

**Normalization:**

- Apply 3NF (third normal form) for transactional data to prevent anomalies
- Denormalize selectively for read-heavy access patterns (document justification)
- Separate read models from write models if queries are complex

**Constraints:**

- Use database constraints for invariants (foreign keys, unique indexes, check constraints)
- Don't rely solely on application-level validation for data integrity
- Document which invariants are enforced where (DB vs app vs both)

**Immutability patterns:**

- For audit-critical domains: append-only logs, never update/delete
- Soft-delete pattern: is_deleted flag, filtered in queries
- Temporal data: effective_from/effective_to ranges for versioned records
- Event sourcing: store state changes as events, reconstruct state by replay

**Versioning & Migration:**

- Schema versioning strategy (migration files with up/down, or declarative schema diffing)
- Backward compatibility considerations for gradual rollouts
- Data migration vs schema migration (separate concerns)

### API Contract Design

**Internal APIs (between layers):**

- Define clear interfaces/protocols for layer boundaries
- Use dependency inversion (upper layers depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations)
- Version internal contracts if modules evolve independently

**External APIs (if networked):**

- RESTful conventions for resource-oriented APIs
- GraphQL for complex query needs and bandwidth optimization
- gRPC for performance-critical service-to-service communication
- Document request/response schemas, error codes, rate limits

**Contract specification:**

- Request/response structure (fields, types, nullability)
- Error handling (error codes, messages, retry semantics)
- Idempotency guarantees where applicable
- Authentication/authorization requirements per endpoint

### Testing Strategy

**Test Pyramid:**

- Base: Unit tests (70%+ of tests) - fast, isolated, cover business logic and data layer
- Middle: Integration tests (20%) - test layer interactions, DB queries, service orchestration
- Top: End-to-end tests (10%) - critical user journeys through full stack

**Test coverage targets:**

- Business logic / domain layer: >90%
- Data layer / repositories: >80%
- Application layer / view models: >80%
- UI layer: Critical flows only (smoke tests)

**Test types to consider:**

- **Unit**: Pure functions, domain logic, calculations
- **Integration**: Repository + DB, service + external API
- **Contract**: API request/response validation against spec
- **Property-based**: Invariant testing (e.g., balance equation always holds)
- **Mutation**: Verify test suite catches injected bugs
- **Performance**: Benchmark critical paths (e.g., list rendering with 10k items)
- **Security**: Penetration tests, static analysis, dependency scanning

### Security & Privacy Principles

**Threat Modeling:**

- Use STRIDE framework (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- Identify assets (what needs protection), entry points, trust boundaries
- Document threats, mitigations, and residual risks

**Data Protection:**

- Classify data by sensitivity (public, internal, confidential, restricted)
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data (use platform keychain/keystore for keys)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3+, certificate pinning for high-value apps)
- Minimize data retention (delete when no longer needed)

**Authentication & Authorization:**

- Prefer platform authentication (biometrics, device PIN) over custom PIN
- Principle of least privilege (users/roles get minimum necessary access)
- Secure session management (timeout, revocation)

**Input Validation:**

- Validate all user input (type, range, format, length)
- Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal)
- Use parameterized queries, never string concatenation for DB queries

**Secrets Management:**

- Never hardcode secrets in source code
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for API keys
- Rotate secrets periodically

**Logging & Monitoring:**

- Log security events (auth failures, privilege escalations)
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII, financial data)
- Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection for abuse prevention

### Performance & Scalability

**Performance Targets:**

- Define latency budgets for critical operations (e.g., app cold start, list scroll, transaction save)
- Identify performance-critical paths early (profile before optimizing)

**Optimization Strategies:**

- Lazy loading for large datasets (pagination, infinite scroll)
- Caching: in-memory (for hot data), persistent (for offline support)
- Indexing: add indexes for frequently queried columns (trade write speed for read speed)
- Denormalization: for read-heavy access patterns (document tradeoffs)
- Background processing: offload expensive work (image compression, sync, batch jobs)

**Scalability Considerations:**

- Will data volume grow unbounded? (define retention/archival policies)
- Can operations be parallelized? (concurrency, work queues)
- Are there batch operations that need throttling? (rate limiting, backpressure)

### Observability

**Logging:**

- Structured logging (JSON) with log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Contextual metadata (user ID, request ID, timestamp, version)
- Log aggregation strategy (local files, remote sink, rotation policy)

**Metrics:**

- Application metrics (feature usage, error rates, latency percentiles)
- System metrics (memory, CPU, storage, network)
- Business metrics (transactions created, budgets hit, export frequency)

**Error Tracking:**

- Crash reporting (if privacy constraints allow)
- Error categorization (client error vs server error vs external dependency failure)
- Alerting thresholds for critical errors

## Workflow: Producing Technical Specifications

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

Read PRD sections to extract:

- **Scope**: What features are in/out
- **Constraints**: Technical, business, regulatory (offline-first? local-only? open-source?)
- **Domain model**: Core entities, relationships, invariants
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, security, accessibility, reliability
- **Open questions**: Unresolved ambiguities that block design

If constraints or NFRs are missing, state assumptions explicitly and mark them "to be validated."

### Step 2: Produce deliverables

- Flag integration risk (Low/Medium/High based on cross-cutting concerns, external dependencies)

**Output format**:

- Mermaid diagram (or similar graph notation)
- Dependency table with columns: Feature, Depends On, Trunk/Branch, Complexity, Risk

- Clear section hierarchy (# ## ###)
- Diagrams where helpful (Mermaid, ASCII art, or references to external tools)
- Tables for structured data (dependencies, work items, API endpoints)
- Code blocks for schemas, interfaces, example queries (use proper syntax highlighting)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**

- Implementation code in specs (specs describe WHAT/HOW, not actual code)
- Overly prescriptive UI design (SDS is not a mockup - leave visual design to UI phase)
- Technology cheerleading (no "X is the best" - use "X because of Y tradeoff")
- Embedding static data from PRD (reference PRD sections, don't duplicate content)

## Key Mindset

An elite Engineering Lead Architect:

- **Thinks in tradeoffs**, not absolutes (every choice has a cost)
- **Documents decisions**, not just outcomes (future engineers need context)
- **Designs for change**, not just current requirements (anticipate evolution)
- **Values simplicity** (the best architecture is the simplest one that works)
- **Prioritizes clarity** (readable specs > clever abstractions)
- **Stays technology-agnostic** (principles over tools - tools change, principles endure)

When uncertain, Claude should:

1. State assumptions explicitly
2. Present multiple options with tradeoffs
3. Recommend based on industry best practices
4. Mark decisions as "to be validated" if context is insufficient
