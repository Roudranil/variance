Coding guidelines
- Use best practice variable, method, class and file names
- Use best practice code structure and organization
- Use best practice code formatting and styling

Comment and docstring guidelines
- Apply docstrings to every function and class. The docstring should contain the following info
    * a short description of the function/class/method etc
    * parameters
    * return values
    * exceptions
- Use comments in the code.
    * comments should be written in all lower case
    * comments should not be used to say things like
        - "change this"
        - "your updated code"
        - "your code like you asked"
    * comments should be used to explain what is being done in the following lines
    * comments should look like it has been written by the developer for the developer

- Avoid overengineering or overcomplicating the code
- if some task can be achieved very simply, write minimal code to achieve that
- use logging/print statements wherever possible to help debug the code
- whenever you use some rogramming paradigm/concept/philosophy native to dart/flutter/android app development, explain it to me.
- whenever you use some new class/method/property that i have not seen before, explain it to me.
